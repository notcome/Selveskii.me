Sometimes we need to calculate the hash value of a string, to get the QR code

to search them each time. Thus, I decided to write my own gadgets library. I
can improve my frontend skills from this process too.

Here is a list of my gadgets library plan:

- Hash generator

- QR code generator

- Braille generator (inputing all dots of each characters instead of typing
  some specific languages)

- ... (comment if you want more)
