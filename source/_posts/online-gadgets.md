Sometimes we need to calculate the hash value of a string, to get the QR code
of a string, or to generate icon (.ico) file of a picture. It is inconvenient
to search them each time. Thus, I decided to write an online gadget library.
This project could also improve my frontend skills.

Here is the list of my online gadget library plan:

##Text encoding

- Hash generator

- QR code generator

- Braille generator (inputing all dots of each characters instead of typing
  some specific languages)

##Image processing

- Icon converter

##References

- [IPA (International Phonetic Alphebet)][1]

If you have good ideas, please comment.
